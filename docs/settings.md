# Settings

Global paths and environment options are centralized in `settings.py`.

Key variables:
- `DATA_PATH`: root directory for datasets.
- `EXPER_PATH`: location where checkpoints, logs and exports are stored.
- `MODEL_NAME`: default model identifier used by training scripts.

Modify this file to point to datasets on your machine before running experiments.
