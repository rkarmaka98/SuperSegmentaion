# Benchmarking and Evaluation Framework

## Overview

Benchmarking is critical to understanding how well SuperSegmentaion performs across a spectrum of conditions. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the performance objectives, the datasets used for evaluation, and the tooling that supports reproducible benchmarking. It offers step-by-step workflows, tables with sample results, and placeholders for diagrams that illustrate key concepts. The goal is to equip practitioners with the knowledge needed to run rigorous experiments and interpret their outcomes.

## Performance Objectives

The primary objectives of the benchmarking process are to evaluate SuperSegmentaion's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. These objectives can be expressed as three guiding questions:

1. **Robustness**: How consistently does the model perform when exposed to varying lighting, occlusion, and geometric transformations?
2. **Accuracy**: How close are the model's predictions to the ground-truth annotations across tasks such as keypoint detection and descriptor matching?
3. **Efficiency**: What is the computational overhead in terms of runtime and memory footprint, and how does this affect deployment in resource-constrained environments?

To address these questions, we establish baseline metrics that serve as reference points. Each metric encapsulates a specific aspect of performance and provides a quantitative measure for comparison.

## Baseline Metrics

Baseline metrics define the criteria against which new experiments are judged. The following metrics are commonly used when benchmarking SuperSegmentaion:

- **Repeatability**: Measures how consistently keypoints are detected across frames or viewpoints. A high repeatability score indicates that the detector is stable across perturbations.
- **Localization Error**: Computes the distance between detected keypoints and ground-truth positions. Lower values indicate more precise localization.
- **Homography Estimation Accuracy**: Evaluates the correctness of estimated homographies by measuring the reprojection error. This metric is particularly important for tasks that rely on accurate geometric transformations.
- **Descriptor Matching Precision and Recall**: When descriptors are used to match keypoints across images, precision reflects the fraction of correct matches among all predicted matches, while recall measures the fraction of ground-truth matches that are correctly predicted.
- **Runtime per Frame**: Captures the time required to process a single frame on a reference GPU or CPU. This metric is vital for applications that demand real-time performance.
- **Memory Consumption**: Reports peak memory usage during inference. Optimizing this metric ensures that the model can run on embedded hardware with limited resources.

To contextualize these metrics, we often compare SuperSegmentaion's results with classical baselines such as SIFT or ORB. These comparisons highlight the gains achieved through modern learning-based approaches.

### Example Baseline Table

The table below illustrates how baseline metrics might be reported. Values are placeholders and should be replaced with actual results from your experiments.

| Metric                       | SuperSegmentaion | SIFT Baseline | ORB Baseline |
|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Repeatability (%)           | 89.2             | 74.5          | 68.3         |
| Localization Error (px)     | 1.25             | 2.10          | 2.45         |
| Homography Error (px)       | 0.85             | 1.40          | 1.75         |
| Matching Precision (%)      | 92.0             | 80.1          | 76.4         |
| Matching Recall (%)         | 88.5             | 77.2          | 72.9         |
| Runtime per Frame (ms)      | 32               | 45            | 40           |
| Memory Consumption (MB)     | 210              | 190           | 175          |

## Datasets

A diverse set of datasets is essential for evaluating how well the model generalizes. The following datasets are commonly employed:

### HPatches

HPatches provides sequences of images with varying illumination and viewpoint changes. It is widely used to assess keypoint repeatability and descriptor matching. SuperSegmentaion integrates seamlessly with the HPatches protocol, enabling direct comparison with published results.

### MegaDepth

MegaDepth offers outdoor images with large variations in depth and perspective. It is suitable for evaluating homography estimation and depth-aware descriptors. When using MegaDepth, ensure that the images are preprocessed to match the input format expected by the model.

### COCO and Cityscapes

COCO and Cityscapes are employed for evaluating the model's ability to operate in complex urban scenes. COCO's wide range of objects and Cityscapes' street-level views allow for stress-testing the detector under cluttered backgrounds and dynamic elements such as vehicles and pedestrians.

### Custom Synthetic Datasets

In some scenarios, synthetic datasets are created to isolate specific variables. For example, a dataset with controlled geometric transformations can help quantify how well the model handles rotation or scaling. Synthetic datasets also facilitate large-scale experiments where acquiring real-world annotations would be costly or impractical.

Each dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. Maintaining clear separation between these splits is crucial for unbiased evaluation.

## Tools and Scripts

SuperSegmentaion includes a suite of tools to streamline the benchmarking process. The scripts are modular, allowing users to mix and match components depending on their evaluation needs.

### Data Export Utilities

- `export.py`: Generates `.npz` files containing keypoints and descriptors for a given dataset. This script is often the first step in the evaluation pipeline.
- `export_classical.py`: Produces outputs for classical baselines like SIFT or ORB, facilitating direct comparisons.

### Evaluation Modules

- `evaluation.py`: Processes exported data to compute repeatability, homography accuracy, and descriptor metrics. It supports batch processing for efficiency.
- `summarize.py`: Aggregates results across multiple runs and stores them in `summary.csv`, allowing for easy visualization and analysis.

### Auxiliary Scripts

- `remove_invalid_npz.py`: Cleans up corrupted or incomplete `.npz` files that may arise from interrupted exports.
- `create_video.py`: Renders qualitative comparisons by overlaying keypoints or matches on video sequences. Although not essential for numeric benchmarking, visualizations can reveal failure modes that metrics might miss.

These tools are designed to be composable. Users can extend them with custom modules for domain-specific metrics or integrate them into automated pipelines using shell scripts or workflow managers.

## Benchmarking Workflow

A structured workflow ensures that experiments are reproducible and comparable. The typical process involves the following steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Download the desired datasets and organize them according to the directory structure expected by the scripts.
   - Preprocess images if necessary, such as resizing or converting to grayscale.

2. **Export Features**
   - Run `export.py` to compute keypoints and descriptors for SuperSegmentaion.
   - Optionally run `export_classical.py` for baseline methods. Ensure that the same configuration (e.g., number of keypoints) is used for fair comparison.

3. **Perform Evaluation**
   - Execute `evaluation.py` on the exported `.npz` files. The script outputs metrics such as repeatability and homography error.
   - Use `summarize.py` to consolidate results across datasets or model checkpoints.

4. **Analyze Results**
   - Interpret the metrics in light of the performance objectives. For example, a high repeatability paired with low localization error indicates robust and precise detections.
   - Compare SuperSegmentaion's results with classical baselines to highlight improvements or regressions.

5. **Iterate**
   - Adjust model parameters, training data, or preprocessing steps based on insights from the evaluation.
   - Re-run the workflow to verify that changes lead to measurable gains.

The workflow can be automated using shell scripts or tools like Makefiles. Automation reduces the risk of human error and accelerates experimentation.

## Reproducibility Guidelines

Ensuring that benchmarks are reproducible is crucial for scientific rigor and collaboration. The following guidelines help achieve consistent results:

- **Version Control**: Track configuration files and scripts in version control to document changes over time.
- **Environment Management**: Use tools like `requirements.txt` or Conda environments to specify exact package versions. Consider containerization for portability.
- **Random Seeds**: Set and record random seeds for all stochastic processes, including data shuffling and model initialization.
- **Hardware Documentation**: Note the hardware used for experiments, such as GPU model and driver version, as performance can vary across devices.
- **Automated Logging**: Integrate logging utilities to capture command-line arguments, metric outputs, and system information.

By adhering to these practices, researchers can confidently compare results and build upon each other's work.

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

Even with a well-defined workflow, several issues can arise during benchmarking:

- **Inconsistent Preprocessing**: Differences in image resizing or normalization can skew results. Always verify that preprocessing steps are uniform across datasets and methods.
- **Missing or Corrupt Files**: Export scripts may fail silently if input data is missing. Use `remove_invalid_npz.py` to identify and clean problematic files.
- **Resource Constraints**: Large datasets can overwhelm system memory. Batch processing and incremental evaluation can mitigate this issue.
- **Metric Misinterpretation**: High precision with low recall might indicate overly conservative matching criteria. Examine both metrics together to get a complete picture.
- **Unstable Baselines**: Classical methods like ORB may have high variance depending on parameter settings. Ensure that baseline configurations are carefully tuned.

Awareness of these pitfalls helps maintain the integrity of benchmarking efforts.

## Extending the Benchmark Suite

The benchmarking framework is designed to be extensible. To add new metrics or datasets:

1. **Define the Metric**: Determine what the metric measures and how it relates to the performance objectives.
2. **Implement the Metric**: Create a Python module that computes the metric from exported data. Place the module within the `evaluations/` directory or a custom location.
3. **Update the Evaluation Script**: Modify `evaluation.py` to include the new metric. Ensure that command-line arguments allow toggling the metric on or off.
4. **Validate**: Run the extended pipeline on a small dataset to verify correctness.
5. **Document**: Update this document and any configuration files to reflect the new addition.

Extensibility encourages experimentation and allows the benchmarking suite to evolve alongside the project.
